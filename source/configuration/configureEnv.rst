.. _configure-environment:

Configure your environment
=============================
A |pyATSbold| instance is simply a directory (folder) in the file system that houses a Python Virtual Environment. Within your virtual environment, you install the |pyATS| and |library| packages and dependencies.

.. tip:: If you're a Windows user, we recommend that you set up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). With WSL, you can run |pyATS| and the |library| in your local environment. This enables on-the-go script development and execution over VPN without the need for a server :question:`Does this apply to both internal and external users?`. Use an app such as Ubuntu Terminal to run commands, including bash, ssh, git, and others.

.. _install-python:

Install Python

    *Result*: The Python interpreter is installed in the specified directory.
    
#.  To verify the installed version::

        python -- version

    *Result*: The system returns the installed version number.

Set up a virtual environment
-----------------------------
*Describe how to do this and why it's useful for installing pyATS | Genie. Is there another way to install the ecosystem without the virtual environment? If yes, describe that too.*

#. Step one
#. Step ...
#. Run the environment check.
