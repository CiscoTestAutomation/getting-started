Quick start guide
=============================
Describe the purpose and objectives of this section - learn how to use the |library|, with real-life scenarios, hands-on practice procedures, and a testbed of mock devices.

Important concepts
-------------------
Describe the key |library| and generic concepts that the user needs to understand before they begin to use the |library|. We'll need to define what these are.

<Concept 1>
^^^^^^^^^^^
*(Each concept can be linked to and reused elsewhere.)*

<Concept 2>
^^^^^^^^^^^

<Concept n...>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When to use the |library|
-------------------------
A description of when to use the |library| (any time you want to check the health of your network), with real-world scenarios.

The |library| for test automation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*(These are the DevNet examples.)*

The |library| for test script creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*(These are the test automation-oriented examples.)*

Use the |library| command line interface (CLI)
----------------------------------------------
*This section explains what the CLI is and how to use it, along with a link to a CLI reference (if there is one).*

Keep the |library| up to date
-----------------------------
*(This content can be re-used elsewhere.)*

Get the latest core (infrastructure?) updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Procedure for using pip install |geniecmd| --upgrade (will this be the same?) and info about how often we update the packages, recommendations for how often the user should run this.

Update the |library| packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Procedure for using pip install <package name> --upgrade to update the packages. How does a user know when there has been an upgrade? Can they sign up for notifications or watch the Git repo? If yes, we should explain that procedure here.*

Test a network of mock devices
-------------------------------
*Procedure to download/clone the test file from Git, and then use Genie to connect to and test those devices.*

Download or clone the Git repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Step one 
#. Step two
#. Step n 

Configure the testbed.yaml file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*(Make sure this concept was explained in the "Important concepts" section.)*

#. Step one 
#. Step two
#. Step n 

Connect to the mock devices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Step one 
#. Step two
#. Step n 

Use the |library| to test a device upgrade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*These are the steps for upgrading the device versions and then seeing the before and after views.*

#. Step one 
#. Step two
#. Step n
