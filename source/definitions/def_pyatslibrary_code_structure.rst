The |librarybold| contains two types of packages:

#. *Infrastructure* -- The core and base class, released as pip packages. We do *not* make the source code available.
#. *Feature libraries and components* -- The libraries that enable you to create and run reusable test cases. We make the source code available on `GitHub <https://github.com/CiscoTestAutomation/genielibs>`_ for user-community contributions.
