.. title:: Types of library packages

The |library| contains two types of packages:

#. *Infrastructure* -- The core and base class, released as pip packages. We do *not* make the source code available.
#. *Feature libraries and components* -- The libraries that enable you to create and run reusable test cases. We make the source code available for user-community contributions.
