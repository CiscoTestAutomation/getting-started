The |library| Diff functionality enables you to compare "snapshots" of your network so that you can easily see any changes. For any two Python dictionaries or objects with a consistent data structure (the set of key-value pairs), the system compares the keys and identifies differences. You can exclude keys that you don't want to compare.
