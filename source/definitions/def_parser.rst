A parser converts device output into a Python dictionary, which stores the device data as a set of key-value pairs. This process harmonizes the data (makes it consistent) across different types of communication interfaces, including CLI, REST, NETCONF, and others. 

The |library| parsers create standardized output for ``show`` commands, which means that you can write and run reusable automation scripts. In the |pyATS| ecosystem, parsers are typically written using the ``Metaparser`` package.
