Real-world examples
======================
*Describe the purpose and objectives of This topic. This should contain a number of step-by-step worked examples of common tasks, along with clear statements of the results and each step, and a statement of the overall result. We could split each example into its own file, if they get too big.*

<Example 1>
^^^^^^^^^^^
*(Each example can be linked to and reused elsewhere.)*

Problem
""""""""
*A clear statement of an issue or common task.*

Solution
""""""""
*A high-level statement of how to use Genie to solve the problem.*

Steps
""""""
*Step-by-step details of how to implement the solution.*
